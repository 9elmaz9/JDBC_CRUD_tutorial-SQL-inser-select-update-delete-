To begin, make sure you have the following pieces of software installed on your computer:
JDK (download JDK 7).
MySQL (download MySQL Community Server 5.6.12). You may also want to download MySQL Workbench - a graphical tool for working with MySQL databases.
JDBC Driver for MySQL (download MySQL Connector/J 5.1.25). Extract the zip archive and put the mysql-connector-java-VERSION-bin.jar file into classpath (in a same folder as your Java source files).
