The following code snippet will update the record of “Bill Gates” as we inserted previously:

String sql = "UPDATE Users SET password=?, fullname=?, email=? WHERE username=?";
 
PreparedStatement statement = conn.prepareStatement(sql);
statement.setString(1, "123456789");
statement.setString(2, "William Henry Bill Gates");
statement.setString(3, "bill.gates@microsoft.com");
statement.setString(4, "bill");
 
int rowsUpdated = statement.executeUpdate();
if (rowsUpdated > 0) {
    System.out.println("An existing user was updated successfully!");
}



This code looks very similar to the INSERT code above, except the query type is UPDATE.
