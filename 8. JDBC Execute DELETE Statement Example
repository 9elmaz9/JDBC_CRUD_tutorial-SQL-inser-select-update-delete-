The following code snippet will delete a record whose username field contains “bill”:


String sql = "DELETE FROM Users WHERE username=?";
 
PreparedStatement statement = conn.prepareStatement(sql);
statement.setString(1, "bill");
 
int rowsDeleted = statement.executeUpdate();
if (rowsDeleted > 0) {
    System.out.println("A user was deleted successfully!");
}

So far we have one through some examples demonstrating how to use JDBC API to execute SQL INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE and DELETE statements. The key points to remember are:
Using a Statement for a static SQL query.
Using a PreparedStatement for a parameterized SQL query and using setXXX() methods to set values for the parameters.
Using execute() method to execute general query.
Using executeUpdate() method to execute INSERT, UPDATE or DELETE query
Using executeQuery() method to execute SELECT query.
Using a ResultSet to iterate over rows returned from a SELECT query, using its next() method to advance to next row in the result set, and using getXXX() methods to retrieve values of columns.
